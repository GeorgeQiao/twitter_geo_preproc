geo_filter.py is an example script for filtering to geocoded tweets from Twitter's Streaming API.

In particular, this script uses various regexes that gets substantially more
tweets than Twitter's own official geo metadata, from a particular sources
(lat/long coordinates in the user.location field).  In the past, these
unofficial data were the only source of geolocation metadata.

For completeness, a copy of my Twitter tokenizer is thrown in here too.
